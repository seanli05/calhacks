# Cal Hacks: Government Letter Agent

*Name TBD (shortlist: Kinvoy, Unhold).*

A WhatsApp agent that helps immigrant families deal with immigration letters, starting with the USCIS I-797C asylum interview notice. Send a photo of a letter, and the agent:

1. explains it in your language: what it is, the deadline, and what's being asked;
2. checks that it's legitimate by comparing the letter's phone number with the agency's official one;
3. with your consent, calls the agency, navigates the phone menu, and waits on hold;
4. rings your phone when a human picks up, then sends a summary on WhatsApp afterward.

A web dashboard shows the live call timeline, the case, and what the agent remembers about you.

## How it works

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Orchestrator** | The only agent that converses with the user on WhatsApp |
| **Research agent** | Reads the letter, verifies it, and writes the case brief for the call |
| **Phone agent** | Places the call, handles the menu and hold, and brings in the user |
| **Shared modules** | Translation, memory writer, message relay, glossary worker |

Components hand work to each other through Postgres (`jobs` and `events` tables), not direct calls.

**Stack:** Python 3.12 · FastAPI · Postgres (SQLModel + asyncpg) · Claude (Anthropic SDK) · Pipecat · Twilio Voice and WhatsApp · Cartesia · Next.js dashboard · ngrok

## Getting started

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd calhacks
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your keys
```

You'll need:
- Anthropic and Cartesia API keys
- Twilio credentials, an agent number, and a mock agency number
- Your phone joined to the Twilio WhatsApp sandbox (the session expires 3 days after joining, so re-join before the demo)
- A local Postgres database (set `DATABASE_URL`)
- ngrok for public webhook URLs (set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`)

Run commands for each service will be added here as they land.

## Development

```bash
ruff format . && ruff check --fix .   # format + lint
pytest                                # tests
```

- Work on a branch, open small PRs, and merge to `main` often.
- Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) before writing code. It has the product rules that can't be broken and the team's engineering conventions.
